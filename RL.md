Making lots of progress so far on the app!  Ive been continuing with the lessons and moving forward and after im done with the daily lessons I continue to work on Project 3.  I am so close!  Here is the what I have so far, I have 3 todos that are the main focus to my problems that I cant seem to fix.   If anyone is up for a googlehangouts tomorrow or hosted meeting on Zoom with a graduated AND classmate, that would be so amazing!
